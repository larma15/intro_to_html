Using Python comments explain the following terms to an average Ugandan (senior 4/6 educated person) ;

Programming, Variable, Partioning, Memory address, Assignment, Declaring, Comment, An operator, An operand, Type cast, Statement, Code, Syntax, Semantics? 
Programming :This is like a boss and a servant , a boss gives instructions to the servant on what he wants to be done and step by step the task is completed .
VARIABLE: This is like a box or basket you keep your items ie x=15 meaning “x”is the variable holding  number “15”.
PARTIONING: This is like dividing a room into sections simply meaning creating spaces on the memory or hard drive of the computer
MEMORY ADDRESS: A memory address is like the location of a specific box in a huge storage room.
The computer uses these addresses to find and retrieve the values stored in variables.
ASSIGNMENT: Assignment is like putting a new value into a labeled box. 
# For example, x = 10 means you're replacing the old value in the box labeled x with the new value 10.
x = 10
DECLARATION: Declaring a variable is like telling the computer that you want to use a new box to store a value. 
# In Python, you don't need to declare variables before using them, but in some languages, you do.
COMMENT: A comment is like a foot note you write down for reference or rememberance or others and in python a comment is indicated by a “#”
AN OPERATOR:An operator is like a symbol that instructs a computer on what to do to the codes in the programe ie “a+b” instructs a computer to add contents of to contents of b
AN OPERAND: An operand is like the value that an operator acts on.
Ie in “a=3,e=2” therefore”2” and “3” are the operands
TYPE CAST: Type casting is like changing the label on a box to indicate that it now holds a different type of value. 
# For example, converting a string to an integer.
x = "123"
y = int(x)  # type casting string to integer
STATEMENT: A statement is like a single instruction that the computer executes. 
# In Python, statements are usually one line of code.
print("Hello, world!")  # this is a statement
CODE: Code is like the entire set of instructions that you write for the computer to follow. 
# It's like a recipe for the computer.
SYNTAX: Syntax is like the grammar rules for writing code. 
# If you don't follow the syntax rules, the computer won't be able to understand your code.

SEMANTICS: Semantics is like the meaning of the code. 
# It's about what the code actually does, not just what it looks like.
List any 4 examples of computer memories you know.
RAM (Random Access Memory)
ROM (Read-Only Memory)
 Hard Drive
 Flash Drive (or USB Drive)
Discuss the relationship between HDD, Ram and CPU in the context of a soft engineer.
Hard disk drive (HDD) stores all applications ,softwares installed onto the computer ie all data on the machine
Random access memory(RAM) stores data being used by the computer and once it shuts down the data is lost
Central processing unit (CPU) this the unit responsible for executing tasks , calculations on the computer 
The Relationship:

- The CPU accesses data from RAM, which acts as a cache for the HDD. This hierarchy (HDD → RAM → CPU) optimizes performance by minimizing the time it takes for the CPU to access data.
- When RAM is full, the system may use virtual memory, which uses a portion of the HDD as an extension of RAM. However, this can lead to performance degradation due to the slower access times of HDDs compared to RAM.s

Using code/statements, demonstrate the use of different Python Operators (the most commonly used, please use comments to discribe the meaning of the operators demonstrated)
# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 3

# Addition
result = a + b  # Adds a and b
print(result)  # prints: 13

# Subtraction
result = a - b  # Subtracts b from a
print(result)  # prints: 7

# Multiplication
result = a * b  # Multiplies a and b
print(result)  # prints: 30

# Division
result = a / b  # Divides a by b
print(result)  # prints: 3.3333333333333335

# Modulus (remainder)
result = a % b  # Returns the remainder of a divided by b
print(result)  # prints: 1

# Comparison Operators
x = 5
y = 10

# Equal to
result = x == y  # Checks if x is equal to y
print(result)  # prints: False

# Not equal to
result = x != y  # Checks if x is not equal to y
print(result)  # prints: True

# Greater than
result = x > y  # Checks if x is greater than y
print(result)  # prints: False

# Less than
result = x < y  # Checks if x is less than y
print(result)  # prints: True


# Assignment Operators
var = 5

# Simple assignment
var = 10  # Assigns 10 to var
print(var)  #prints: 10
